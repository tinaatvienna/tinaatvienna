Hi, I am Christina, and my sisters boyfriend told me that I might find help here...I just started a new job and we are looking for a junior it manager in vienna and I am having a hard time finding one. So I thought the classic platforms (such as karriere.at) might not be the right. But I have no other ideas where to look. Have you got any recommendations for me please? Thanks a lot and Merry Christmas!
